# Portfolio_JWD1
<br>
The Plan: Subject to change.
<br>
This will be my first portfolio. This is a rough draft really and as I go and depending what I am learning at the time will forsee what is going to end up in my file. I hope to learn a bunch of new things and be able to create a better workflow.
<br>
<ul>
  <li>I want to have my profile pic on the site.</li>
  <li>I want to pic a great color palet that looks calm and professional.</li>
  <li>I want a hidden button that will take you to a page with some personal information.</li>
  <li>A place where someone can contact me via email to leave comments and critique.</li>
  <li>The news section can give some resources that I used to make this site.</li>
  <li>Images that will take you to another page. The image should have an objet in the picture you can click on the image, not to be mistaken with clicking the whole img. I might want to make it a couple different objects in the picture that will take you somewhere.</li>
  <li>Make sure not to just copy code but know what it does and make note in the code what everything does and why. Or there will be a section in the readme that will discuss the steps I took on this site.</li>
